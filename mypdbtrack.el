pdb prompt and presents the line in the source file where the
program is stopped in a pop-up buffer.  It's similar to what
gud-mode does for debugging C programs with gdb, but without
having to restart the program."

If the traceback target file path is invalid, we look for the
most recently visited `python-mode' buffer which either has the
name of the current function or class, or which defines the
function or class.  This is to provide for scripts not in the
local file system (e.g., Zope's 'Script (Python)', but it's not
Zope specific).  If you put a copy of the script in a buffer
